# Introduction

**pcl.js** is a [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) that runs in the browser, powered by [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) is a standalone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing. 

**pcl.js** uses the same API as PCL, is optimized for JavaScript, and provides TypeScript types, which are easy to use. The same piece of logic is written in Javascript and C++ as follows:

|         pcl.js(JavaScript)         |          PCL(C++ )           |
